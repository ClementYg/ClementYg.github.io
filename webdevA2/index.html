                                Similar to Birth Charts, the Egyptians focused on the rising decan and where each decan
                                fell
                                relative to it at the moment of birth. They associated a topic to each decan, i.e 28th

                                was
                                associated with livelihood

                                The decans were speculated to be the concept of the 12 houses, which associated the

                                Hellenistic astrology emerged after the conquests of Alexander coming from Egypt.

                                This astrology system represents the establishment of the 'fourfold' system that we use
                                in
                                modern-day, as well as the synthesis of Mesopotamian and Egyptian astrological
                                traditions.
                                - The planets and most things we associate with them
                                - the signs of the zodiac and qualities we associate with them
                                - the concept of 12 houses and their basic meanings
                                - the concept of aspects,

                                The Hellenistic astrology system represents two frameworks being merged
                                - The movement of the planets along the ecliptic
                                - the 24-hour cycle of the movement of the planets in the diurnal rotation

                                Egyptian decans were now overlaid on top of zodiac, where it became 36 10-degree
                                subdivisions of
                                the signs of zodiacs, with 3 decans in each sign.

                                The rising zodiacal sign came from the rising decan at the moment of birth and treating
                                that
                                as
                                important and numbering them based of the subdivisions

                                The rising zodiacal sign was then attributed to represent the 1st house of the native,
                                and
                                the
                                rest of the signs were numbered orderly based after the 1st house. This is the whole

                                Hellenistic astrology is transmitted to India, merging with preexisting astrology in

                                including the lunar zodiac nakshatras, starting a tradition of astrology there over the
                                next
                                2000 years.

                                Western Roman Empire fell and Astrology stops being practiced in Western Europe as much,
                                with
                                general decrease in learning and increased hostility towards astrology from
                                Christianity.

                                Hellenistic Astrology had stopped in general due to other advents and events occurring
                                in
                                the
                                world.

                                More importantly, the [[Horary Astrology]] became relevant and established as part of
                                the
                                tradition.

                                Electional Astrology is founded based of the moment of time a question is asked, for
                                important
                                events or personal questions such as the best date for marriage

                                Theosophical Society grew. People were more accepting and found it fashionable to talk
                                about
                                karma, reincarnation and things alike, leading to renewed public interest

                                A lot of astrology's popularisation can be contributed by Alan Leo, who made sure it was
                                easier
                                to access and understand.

                                Astrology being more about prediction in traditional astrology to more about character
                                analysis.
                                After the birth of depth psychology in the 20th century, it eventually centered around
                                psychological analysis and introspection.

                                1930s onwards, Sun-sign astrology was popularised and astrological columns focused on
                                the
                                zodiac
                                was published in newspapers and magazines

                                Generally, shift in 20th century as its more on deep psychology and character depth as
                                opposed
                                to predictive fatality or life. More innovation > tradition

                                Outer planets were found, thus integrated to replacing the more general placements
                                traditionally. I.e, Uranus replaced Saturn as the ruler of Aquarius

                                Increased accessibility due to computers and easy calculation without prior knowledge

                                Techniques were rediscovered, using whole sign houses and sect to propose a
                                redevelopment of
                                traditional key ideas of astrology. Going back into ancient texts, techniques may give
                                us
                                greater insight on development and innovation of astrology.

                    <h3> Polarity </h3>
                    <p class="infoPara">It is just a shortcut way to explain how some of the signs characteristics
                        express themselves.
                        Nothing more, nothing less (no, positive signs are not automatically "good", nor are negative
                        signs
                        automatically "bad").

                        Every sign has a polarity. Sometimes called positive/negative, masculine/feminine, or other
                        variations of the same thing (yin/yang, so on).

                        In general, positive signs are more outgoing, expressive, forceful, and proactive, while
                        negative
                        signs are generally more introspective, slightly reserved, perhaps, and reactive, or passive.

                    <h3> Modality </h3>
                    <p class="infoPara"> Modalities are qualities or modes of expression. as the tropical zodiac is tied
                        to the seasons, each
                        zodiac sign is associated with its seasonal stage

                        CARDINAL signs “initiate” - they are enterprising, action-oriented, & begin each season. Aries,
                        Cancer, Libra, Capricorn. Cardinal energy can sometimes struggle with the follow-through.

                        FIXED signs “maintain” - they are stabilizing, persistent, & sustain the season. Taurus, Leo,
                        Scorpio, Aquarius. Fixed signs can be stubborn & set in their ways.

                        MUTABLE signs “adapt” - they are versatile, flexible, & end the season. Gemini, Virgo,
                        Sagittarius,
                        Pisces. Mutable signs can be restless & inconsistent, or feel guilty for doing all the things.

                        More can be read from the beginner book by Carole Taylor, "Astrology: Using the Wisdom of the
                        Stars
